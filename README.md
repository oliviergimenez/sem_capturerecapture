# R and Jags code for fitting fitting structural equation capture-recapture models

In this repo, we provide the R and Jags code along with the data to reproduce the blackbird case study in Cubaynes, S, C. Doutrelant, A. Gregoire, P. Perret, B. Faivre, and O. Gimenez (2012). [Testing hypotheses in evolutionary ecology with imperfect detection: Structural equation modeling of mark-recapture data](https://oliviergimenez.github.io/pubs/Cubaynesetal2012.pdf). Ecology 93: 248-255.
